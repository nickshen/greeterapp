# greeterapp
### + editable greeting from client + highest bid promotional message
Solidity + React basic web3 app

Extended the basic greeter app by allowing edit access to greeting contract's greeting string from the client.
Added a promotional string which allows overwriting of the current promotional string only if the bidded value is greater than currently existing highest bid value.
Had trouble getting a smart contract int to work well on the client. Would love to know why.
